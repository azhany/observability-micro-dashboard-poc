# NFR Assessment: 2.3.reactive-metric-chart-component

Date: 2026-01-18
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Tenant data isolation depends entirely on backend validation of the SSE URL.
- Performance: PASS - Chart.js optimizations (`update('none')`, `animation: false`) and data point limiting (max 50) implemented correctly.
- Reliability: PASS - Connection error handling and "OFFLINE" status tracking added during QA refactor.
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Zero automated tests (unit or component) implemented.

## Critical Issues

1. **Zero Automated Tests** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Regressions in chart logic or StreamService connection handling will go undetected.
   - Fix: Implement Vitest/Playwright tests as outlined in the test strategy.

2. **Tenant Data Isolation** (Security)
   - Risk: Potential for cross-tenant data leakage via SSE URL manipulation.
   - Fix: Ensure the backend controller for `/api/v1/stream/{tenant}` strictly validates the `{tenant}` against the authenticated session.

## Quick Wins

- Add unit tests for `StreamService`: ~2 hours
- Add component tests for `RealtimeChart`: ~3 hours
