# Story 4.4: Historical Trend Charting

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** System Operator,
**I want** to toggle my dashboard charts to show 1-hour, 24-hour, and 7-day views,
**so that** I can perform root cause analysis using historical data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chart components are updated to support a "Time Range" selector.
2. Selecting a range > 1 hour automatically switches the data source from the SSE stream/raw table to the 1m or 5m rollup tables.
3. The UI provides a seamless transition between "Live" and "Historical" modes.
4. Alert markers (e.g., red vertical lines) are overlaid on the chart where state transitions occurred.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Chart Component Enhancement** (AC: 1, 3)
    - [x] Add `TimeRangeSelector` component to the dashboard.
    - [x] Update `MetricChart` component to handle static data arrays in addition to live SSE updates.
    - [x] Logic to "pause" SSE updates when in historical mode.
- [x] **Data Fetching Logic** (AC: 2)
    - [x] Implement `fetchHistoricalMetrics` in the Vue service layer.
    - [x] Mapping:
        - 1h -> `resolution=raw` or `resolution=1m`
        - 24h -> `resolution=1m`
        - 7d -> `resolution=5m`
- [x] **Alert Overlay Implementation** (AC: 4)
    - [x] Fetch alert history for the selected time range.
    - [x] Use Chart.js annotation plugin (or equivalent) to draw vertical lines/markers at alert transition points.
- [x] **UI/UX Polishing** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Ensure smooth transitions (loading states) when switching ranges.
    - [x] Clear "Historical" vs "Live" indicator. [Source: Story 2.3]
