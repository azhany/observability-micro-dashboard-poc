# Story 2.3: Reactive Metric Chart Component (Live Mode)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** System Operator,
**I want** to see metrics visualized on a live-updating line chart,
**so that** I can observe trends in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A reusable Vue 3 chart component (e.g., using Chart.js or ApexCharts) is implemented.
2. The component listens to the SSE stream and updates its data points without a full re-render.
3. The chart supports a "Live" mode indicator (e.g., a pulsing red dot).
4. Performance is optimized to handle high-frequency updates (e.g., 1 update/sec) without lag.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Install Dependencies (AC: 1)
    - [x] Add `chart.js` to `app/package.json`.
    - [x] Run `npm install`.
- [x] Task 2: Implement Stream Service (AC: 2, 4)
    - [x] Create `app/resources/js/Services/StreamService.ts`.
    - [x] Implement `connect(tenantId)` using `EventSource`.
    - [x] Implement event dispatching/subscription mechanism (e.g., `on(event, callback)`).
    - [x] Handle connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, error handling).
    - [x] Ensure only one connection per tenant is active.
- [x] Task 3: Create Realtime Chart Component (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Create `app/resources/js/Components/RealtimeChart.vue`.
    - [x] Use `Chart.js` to render a line chart.
    - [x] Props: `tenantId`, `metricName`, `label`, `color`.
    - [x] On mount, subscribe to `StreamService` for the specific `metricName`.
    - [x] On data received: `chart.data.datasets[0].data.push()` and `chart.update('none')` for performance.
    - [x] Limit data points (e.g., keep last 50 points) to prevent memory leaks.
    - [x] Implement "Live" indicator (pulsing red dot) in the top corner of the widget.
- [x] Task 4: Integration Verification (AC: 2)
    - [x] Add the component to a temporary test page or existing dashboard page to verify it receives data.
    - [x] Verify 60FPS performance during updates.

    - SSE Endpoint: `/api/v1/stream/{tenant}`. [Source: Story 2.2]
    - Data format from SSE: JSON payload. [Source: Story 2.2]
- **Tech Stack**:
    - **Frontend**: Vue 3.4, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - **Charting**: Chart.js (implied by "Chart.js" in AC and "Update Chart.js" in Core Workflows). [Source: docs/architecture/6-core-workflows.md]
- **Architecture**:
    - **Project Structure**: Components in `app/resources/js/Components` (Standard Laravel/Inertia), Services in `app/resources/js/Services`. [Source: docs/architecture/9-unified-project-structure.md]
    - **Data Flow**: SSE Controller -> Stream Service -> Chart Component. [Source: docs/architecture/6-core-workflows.md]
- **Performance**:
    - Target: < 100ms from DB to Browser. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-and-performance.md]
    - Dashboard FPS: 60 FPS. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-and-performance.md]
    - Optimization: Use non-reactive arrays for Chart.js data if possible, or careful Vue reactivity to avoid deep watchers on large datasets. Use `chart.update('none')` (mode: none) for smooth animations.

    - `app/resources/js/Services/StreamService.ts`
    - `app/resources/js/Components/RealtimeChart.vue`

### Testing
- **Test Strategy**:
    - **Unit Tests**: Test `StreamService` connection logic (mock `EventSource`).
    - **Component Tests**: Mount `RealtimeChart.vue`, mock `StreamService`, emit event, assert Chart update (might be hard to test Chart.js canvas, check internal data or wrapper calls).
    - **Manual Verification**: Since this is a UI component, visual verification of the "Live" indicator and smooth updates is key.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Antigravity (Gemini)

### Debug Log References
None

### Completion Notes List
- Installed `chart.js`.
- Implemented `StreamService` singleton for SSE management.
- Implemented `RealtimeChart` using `chart.js` with `update('none')` for performance.
- Added `ChartTest.vue` for verification.
- Verified build success.
- **QA Fixes Applied**:
    - Added `vitest`, `happy-dom`, `@vue/test-utils` and configured `vitest.config.ts`.
    - Added unit tests for `StreamService` (100% logic coverage).
    - Added component tests for `RealtimeChart` (Connection, Props, Live Indicator, Accessibility).
    - Updated `RealtimeChart` to show "CONNECTING" state instead of confusing default "LIVE".
    - Verified `StreamController` implements strict tenant validation.

## QA Results



### Review Date: 2026-01-18



### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)



### Code Quality Assessment



The implementation is now fully robust. The addition of a comprehensive test suite (Vitest) covering `StreamService` (connection logic, singleton behavior) and `RealtimeChart` (rendering, updates, indicators) addresses the previous maintainability concerns. Security validation for tenant isolation has been verified in the backend controller.



### Refactoring Performed



- **File**: `app/resources/js/Services/StreamService.ts`

  - **Change**: Added `isConnected()` method and tracked connection state (Previous Review).

  - **Why**: To allow components to react to connection status changes.

  - **How**: Added a `connected` boolean updated on `open`, `message`, and `error` events.



- **File**: `app/resources/js/Components/RealtimeChart.vue`

  - **Change**: Added `hasError` and `isLive` status tracking with improved UI indicators (Previous Review).

  - **Why**: The previous implementation didn't accurately reflect connection failures.

  - **How**: Added listeners for `connected` and `error` events from `StreamService`.



### Compliance Check



- Coding Standards: [✓]

- Project Structure: [✓]

- Testing Strategy: [✓] Vitest suite implemented (33 passing tests).

- All ACs Met: [✓]



### Improvements Checklist



- [x] Refactored `StreamService` to expose connection status

- [x] Improved `RealtimeChart` status indicators and error handling

- [x] **Must Fix**: Implement Vitest unit tests for `StreamService` (Done)

- [x] **Must Fix**: Implement Component tests for `RealtimeChart` (Done)

- [x] Verify backend tenant validation for `/api/v1/stream/{tenant}` (Verified in `StreamController.php`)



### Security Review



**SEC-001 (Tenant Data Isolation)**: MITIGATED.

Verified that `StreamController::stream` performs an explicit check: `if (!$user->tenants()->where('tenants.id', $tenant->id)->exists()) { abort(403); }`. This ensures a user cannot access another tenant's stream by manipulating the URL.



### Performance Considerations



Optimized Chart.js rendering is correctly implemented. Data point limiting (max 50) prevents long-term memory accumulation.
