# Story 3.3: Go System Agent - MQTT Publisher

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** System Operator,
**I want** the Go agent to push its collected metrics to the MQTT broker,
**so that** they can be visualized on the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Go agent implements an MQTT client that connects to the Mosquitto broker.
2. Agent publishes metrics using the required topic structure: `metrics/{tenant_id}/{agent_id}/{metric_name}`.
3. Agent handles connection retries gracefully.
4. Agent includes an `agent_id` and `timestamp` in every published payload.
5. Configuration supports MQTT broker address, port, username, and password via environment variables.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Create directory `agent/internal/publisher`.
    - [ ] Install Paho MQTT library: `go get github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang`.
    - [ ] Implement `publisher.go` with a client wrapper that handles connection and publishing. [Source: docs/architecture/8-go-agent-structure.md]
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 1, 3, 5)
    - [ ] Update configuration in `agent/cmd/agent/main.go` to include MQTT settings (MQTT_BROKER, MQTT_PORT, MQTT_USER, MQTT_PASS).
    - [ ] Implement robust connection logic with retries if the broker is unavailable.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 2, 4)
    - [ ] Modify `agent/cmd/agent/main.go` to initialize the publisher.
    - [ ] Update `collectAndPrint` (or rename to `collectAndPublish`) to send metrics via MQTT instead of (or in addition to) stdout.
    - [ ] Ensure topic format matches: `metrics/{tenant_id}/{agent_id}/{metric_name}`. [Source: docs/MQTT_BRIDGE.md]
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the publisher (mocking the MQTT client if possible).
    - [ ] Verify message delivery using `mosquitto_sub` or by checking the MQTT Bridge logs in the Laravel app.
    - [ ] Verify that metrics appear in the database/dashboard if the bridge is running.

## Dev Notes
- **MQTT Topic Structure**: `metrics/{tenant_id}/{agent_id}/{metric_name}` [Source: docs/MQTT_BRIDGE.md]
- **MQTT Payload**: Must be JSON. The `Metric` model in `agent/internal/models/metric.go` already includes `value`, `timestamp`, `agent_id`, and `tenant_id`. [Source: docs/MQTT_BRIDGE.md]
- **Default Credentials**: For development, use `bridge_user` / `bridge_pass`. [Source: docs/MQTT_BRIDGE.md]
- **Broker Host**: Use `localhost` for local development outside containers, or `mosquitto` if running inside the docker network.
- **Previous Story Insights**:
    - The CPU collector requires a warm-up call before the main loop starts to ensure non-zero readings. [Source: docs/stories/3.2.go-system-agent-collection.story.md]
    - Metric model is already established and supports JSON marshaling. [Source: agent/internal/models/metric.go]

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `agent/internal/publisher/publisher_test.go`
- **Test Standards**: Standard Go testing library (`testing`).
- **Testing Frameworks**: Use `paho.mqtt.golang` mocking or integration testing with a local Mosquitto.
- **Verification**: Use `mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -u bridge_user -P bridge_pass -t "metrics/#" -v` to verify delivery.
