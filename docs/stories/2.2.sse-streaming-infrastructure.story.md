# Story 2.2: SSE Streaming Infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** System Operator,
**I want** metrics to be streamed to my browser as they are ingested,
**so that** I don't have to manually refresh the page or rely on heavy polling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Laravel implementation of an SSE endpoint `GET /api/v1/stream/{tenant}`.
2. The stream broadcasts new metric events immediately after they are persisted to the database.
3. Redis Pub/Sub or a similar mechanism is used to bridge the background ingestion job to the SSE controller.
4. Connection management ensures that streams are closed correctly when a user leaves the page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Update Ingestion Job for Broadcasting (AC: 2, 3)
    - [ ] Modify `App\Jobs\ProcessMetricSubmission` to publish processed metrics to Redis Pub/Sub.
    - [ ] Use Redis channel pattern: `tenant.{tenant_id}.metrics`.
    - [ ] Payload should be a JSON array of metrics processed in the batch.
- [ ] Task 2: Implement SSE Stream Controller (AC: 1, 3, 4)
    - [ ] Create `App\Http\Controllers\StreamController`.
    - [ ] Implement `stream` method that returns a `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\StreamedResponse`.
    - [ ] Inside the stream, subscribe to the Redis channel for the specific tenant.
    - [ ] Ensure proper SSE headers are set (Content-Type: text/event-stream, Cache-Control: no-cache, Connection: keep-alive).
    - [ ] Handle connection timeout and client disconnects to prevent orphan processes.
- [ ] Task 3: Define Stream Route (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Add route `GET /api/v1/stream/{tenant}` to `routes/web.php`.
    - [ ] Apply `auth` middleware to ensure only logged-in users can access the stream.
    - [ ] (Optional) Add a custom policy or check to ensure user has access to the requested tenant ID.
- [ ] Task 4: Integration Testing (AC: 1, 2, 3)
    - [ ] Create `tests/Feature/StreamTest.php`.
    - [ ] Mock Redis Pub/Sub to verify that `ProcessMetricSubmission` publishes correct data.
    - [ ] Test that the SSE endpoint returns 200 and correct headers.
    - [ ] (Bonus) Use a test client to verify data is received over the stream when a job is processed.

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**:
    - `tenant_id` in database is Binary(16). When publishing to Redis or matching in Controller, ensure UUID string conversion is handled correctly. [Source: docs/architecture/7-database-schema.md]
    - `Metric` model uses `App\Models\Metric`. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]
    - Dashboard uses session-based authentication. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-and-performance.md#security]
- **Data Models**:
    - **Tenant**: Root entity for multi-tenant isolation. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#tenant]
    - **Metric (Raw)**: High-fidelity storage for recent metrics. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#metric-raw]
- **Redis Pub/Sub**:
    - Use `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis`.
    - `Redis::publish($channel, json_encode($data))` in the Job.
    - `Redis::subscribe([$channel], function($message) { ... })` in the Controller (Note: `subscribe` is blocking; use in a loop with check for connection status or use `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\StreamedResponse`).
    - Pattern: Job -> Redis Pub/Sub -> SSE Controller -> Dashboard. [Source: docs/architecture/6-core-workflows.md#61-ingest-live-update-the-smoke-test-path]
- **SSE Implementation Details**:
    - Use `ob_start()`, `ob_flush()`, and `flush()` to send data immediately.
    - Example SSE format: `data: {"metric_name": "cpu", "value": 45}\n\n`.
    - Target: < 100ms from DB write to browser receipt. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-and-performance.md#performance-targets]
- **File Locations**:
    - `app/app/Http/Controllers/StreamController.php`
    - `app/app/Jobs/ProcessMetricSubmission.php`
    - `app/routes/web.php`
    - `app/tests/Feature/StreamTest.php` [Source: docs/architecture/9-unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/Feature/StreamTest.php`
- **Test Standards**: Laravel Pest/PHPUnit. [Source: docs/prd/4-technical-assumptions.md#testing-requirements]
- **Frameworks**: PHPUnit, Mockery for Redis.
- **Specific Requirements**:
    - Verify Redis channel names follow the `tenant.{uuid}.metrics` pattern.
    - Verify SSE stream headers.
    - Ensure 401 Unauthorized if not logged in.
