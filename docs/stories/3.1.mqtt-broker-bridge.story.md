# Story 3.1: MQTT Broker & Bridge Infrastructure

## Status
Ready for Review (QA Fixes Applied)

## Story
**As a** System Operator,
**I want** an MQTT broker (Mosquitto) integrated into the environment,
**so that** I can ingest metrics from edge devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Mosquitto container added to `docker-compose.yml`.
2. A "Bridge" service (either a separate Go process or a Laravel Artisan command) subscribes to `metrics/#`.
3. The bridge parses the topic structure `metrics/{tenant_id}/{agent_id}/{metric_name}`.
4. Parsed messages are forwarded to the existing ingestion pipeline (reusing the same Redis job as HTTP ingestion).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Mosquitto Integration (AC: 1)
    - [x] Create `docker/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf` with basic anonymous access and persistence enabled for PoC.
    - [x] Create `docker/mosquitto/data` and `docker/mosquitto/log` directories.
    - [x] Add `mosquitto` service to `docker-compose.yml` (ports 1883 for MQTT, 9001 for WebSockets).
    - [x] Ensure `mosquitto` is on the `observability-network`.
- [x] Task 2: MQTT Client Library Installation (AC: 2)
    - [x] Install `php-mqtt/client` via composer in the `app` directory.
- [x] Task 3: Implement MQTT Bridge Artisan Command (AC: 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Create `app/app/Console/Commands/MqttBridge.php`.
    - [x] Implement `handle()` to connect to Mosquitto (host: `mosquitto`, port: 1883).
    - [x] Subscribe to the wildcard topic `metrics/#`.
    - [x] Implement topic parsing logic to extract `tenant_id`, `agent_id`, and `metric_name` from `metrics/{tenant_id}/{agent_id}/{metric_name}`.
    - [x] Parse message payload (JSON) which should contain at least `value` and optionally `timestamp` and `dedupe_id`.
    - [x] Find/Validate `Tenant` by `tenant_id` (UUID).
    - [x] Dispatch `App\Jobs\ProcessMetricSubmission` with the validated tenant and formatted metric data.
    - [x] Ensure robust error handling for malformed topics or payloads.
- [x] Task 4: Bridge Service Management (AC: 2)
    - [x] Document how to run the bridge command (e.g., `php artisan mqtt:bridge`).
    - [x] Add the bridge command to the `dev` script in `app/composer.json` using `concurrently` for easy local development.
- [x] Task 5: Verification & Testing (AC: 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Create a feature test `app/tests/Feature/MqttBridgeTest.php` that mocks the MQTT client and verifies the bridge dispatches the ingestion job.
    - [x] Manually verify using `mosquitto_pub` from the host or another container.

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**:
    - `ProcessMetricSubmission` job is the central ingestion point. It handles `Metric::upsert`/`insert` and publishes to Redis Pub/Sub for SSE. [Source: app/app/Jobs/ProcessMetricSubmission.php]
    - Metric ingestion expects a `tenant_id` which corresponds to the `id` (UUID) of the `Tenant` model. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **Tech Stack**:
    - **MQTT Broker**: Mosquitto 2.0. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
    - **Library**: `php-mqtt/client` is the standard PHP library for MQTT.
- **File Locations**:
    - Mosquitto Config: `docker/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`
    - Artisan Command: `app/app/Console/Commands/MqttBridge.php`
    - Job: `app/app/Jobs/ProcessMetricSubmission.php`
- **Testing Requirements**:
    - Use `Tests\TestCase`.
    - Mock the MQTT client to avoid needing a live broker for automated feature tests.
- **Project Structure Notes**:
    - Infrastructure configs (like Mosquitto) live in `docker/`. [Source: docs/architecture/9-unified-project-structure.md]
    - Custom Artisan commands are located in `app/app/Console/Commands/`.

### Testing
- **Relevant Testing Standards**:
    - Test file location: `app/tests/Feature/`
    - Framework: PHPUnit (Laravel default).
    - Mocking: Use Mockery or Laravel's built-in mocking for Redis/Jobs.

## QA Results



### Review Date: 2026-01-18



### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)



### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is solid and follows Laravel best practices. The `MqttBridge` Artisan command is well-structured, handles errors gracefully, and correctly integrates with the existing `ProcessMetricSubmission` job. The use of `reflection` in tests to exercise protected methods allows for deep testing of the logic without requiring a live MQTT broker in the CI environment.



### Refactoring Performed

No immediate refactoring was performed as the code is clean and adheres to the established patterns. However, I have noted some technical debt regarding security configuration.



### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]

- Project Structure: [✓]

- Testing Strategy: [✓]

- All ACs Met: [✓]



### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified MQTT topic parsing logic and error handling.

- [x] Confirmed mock-based testing approach for the bridge command.

- [ ] **Critical**: Disable anonymous access in `mosquitto.conf` before production.

- [ ] **High**: Implement a process manager (Supervisor) for the bridge command to ensure long-term stability and auto-restart.

- [ ] Consider adding a "graceful shutdown" listener to the bridge command to disconnect cleanly from the broker.



### Security Review

The current configuration allows anonymous access (`allow_anonymous true`). While acceptable for a PoC, this is a **Critical Risk (SEC-001)** for any environment beyond development. Credentials and ACLs must be implemented.



### Performance Considerations

The bridge is a long-running process. Monitoring for memory leaks in the PHP process is recommended (**PERF-001**). The use of `uniqid()` for client IDs prevents collisions but should be monitored for predictability.



### Files Modified During Review

None.



### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/3.1.mqtt-broker-bridge.yml

Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/3.1.mqtt-broker-bridge-risk-20260118.md

Test design: docs/qa/assessments/3.1.mqtt-broker-bridge-test-design-20260118.md



### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done] (Note: The "CONCERNS" gate status is due to the anonymous access risk, which is acknowledged as PoC-level in the story but must be addressed before production.)
