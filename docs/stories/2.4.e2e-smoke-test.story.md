# Story 2.4: E2E Smoke Test (Ingest -> Chart)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** QA Engineer,
**I want** an automated test that simulates the full data flow,
**so that** I can verify the core PoC value proposition.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Playwright BDD scenario is created: "GIVEN a tenant exists, WHEN I POST a metric, THEN it appears on the Live Dashboard chart within 500ms."
2. The test runs in the containerized environment.
3. The test handles the asynchronous nature of SSE and background jobs (using appropriate wait/assertions).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Environment Setup & Playwright Installation (AC: 2)
    - [x] Install Playwright and dependencies in the `app` directory: `npm install -D @playwright/test`.
    - [x] Install Playwright browsers (if not already in image, or use existing): `npx playwright install --with-deps`.
    - [x] Create `app/playwright.config.ts` configured for the container environment (base URL: `http://localhost`, use appropriate webServer if needed or point to existing nginx).
- [x] Task 2: Implement E2E Smoke Test (AC: 1, 3)
    - [x] Create `app/tests/e2e/smoke-test.spec.ts`.
    - [x] Implement "Ingest -> Chart" flow:
        - [x] Authenticate/Prepare: Use an existing tenant or create one.
        - [x] Navigation: Open the Dashboard Tenant page.
        - [x] Ingestion: Use `axios` or `fetch` to POST a metric to `/api/v1/metrics`.
        - [x] Assertion: Wait for the `RealtimeChart` component to reflect the new data point.
        - [x] Timing: Assert that the update occurs within 500ms of the POST request.
- [x] Task 3: CI/CD Integration & Documentation (AC: 2)
    - [x] Add `test:e2e` script to `app/package.json`.
    - [x] Ensure the test can be run via `docker exec`.
    - [x] Update `README.md` or `DEVELOPMENT.md` with instructions on how to run E2E tests.

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights**:
    - **Ingestion API**: `POST /api/v1/metrics` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. [Source: Story 1.2, 1.3]
    - **SSE Endpoint**: `/api/v1/stream/{tenant}` is used by the frontend to receive updates. [Source: Story 2.2]
    - **Chart Component**: `RealtimeChart.vue` is the component that should update. It tracks the last 50 points. [Source: Story 2.3]
- **Tech Stack**:
    - **E2E Framework**: Playwright. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Performance Targets**:
    - **Total Ingest -> Browser Lag**: Target is < 500ms for the smoke test assertion. [Source: Story 2.4 AC]
    - **Component Latency**: Ingestion (< 50ms) + Persistence (< 450ms) + SSE Broadcast (< 100ms) = 600ms theoretical max, but the 500ms target in AC must be verified. [Source: docs/architecture/10-security-and-performance.md]
- **File Locations**:
    - E2E Tests: `app/tests/e2e/`
    - Playwright Config: `app/playwright.config.ts`
- **Testing Requirements**:
    - Use Playwright's `expect` with polling or custom assertions to handle the async nature of SSE.
    - Mocking is NOT recommended here as this is a smoke test for the *real* flow.
- **Project Structure Notes**:
    - Playwright tests should be co-located with the `app` (Laravel/Vue) source as they test the web interface.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
### Debug Log References
- Linting: Fixed 3 PHP style issues with Laravel Pint (concat_space, not_operator_with_successor_space, braces_position)
- Seeding: Successfully created E2E test data (tenant-demo, test user, API token)
- Tests: Verified 3 E2E test scenarios are properly configured
### Completion Notes List
- **QA Fix Round 1 (2026-01-18)**:
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Added Playwright system dependencies to Dockerfile (libnss3, libatk, libgbm1, etc.) to enable containerized E2E test execution (addresses AC2 and high severity issue)
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Implemented authentication flow in E2E tests - tests now login with test user before accessing dashboard (fixes SSE 401 error and addresses high severity authentication bypass issue)
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Updated E2E tests to use real dashboard route `/dashboard/tenants/{tenant}` instead of test route `/test/chart` (validates actual user experience)
  - Created Login.vue page and LoginController for E2E authentication
  - Updated E2ETestDataSeeder to create test user (test@example.com/password) and associate with tenant-demo
  - Added login/logout routes to web.php
  - Updated README.md with authentication flow documentation
  - All changes address QA gate FAIL status and top issues (Docker dependencies, authentication bypass)
- **Original Implementation**:
  - Installed Playwright v1.57.0 and all browser dependencies (Chromium, Firefox, Webkit)
  - Created playwright.config.ts configured for containerized environment with base URL pointing to nginx
  - Implemented comprehensive E2E smoke test with 3 test scenarios validating the full Ingest -> Chart flow
  - Created E2ETestDataSeeder to set up test tenant (tenant-demo) with authentication token

## QA Results


### Review Date: 2026-01-18 (Re-review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The developer has successfully addressed the critical issues from the previous review. The inclusion of Playwright system dependencies in the Dockerfile enables the required containerized execution. The E2E test now properly authenticates, mirroring real user behavior and verifying the actual security model. The test logic for SSE validation is robust, checking both the status indicator and verifyng canvas pixel data.

### Refactoring Performed

None by QA. Use of `page.request` and `expect` patterns in the test file is appropriate.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Follows patterns.
- Project Structure: [✓] Correct.
- Testing Strategy: [✓] **PASS**. Tests now run in container (AC 2) and correctly handle async flow (AC 3).
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria are now satisfied.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **Critical**: Add Playwright OS dependencies to `Dockerfile`. (Verified)
- [x] **Critical**: Fix `smoke-test.spec.ts` to perform authentication. (Verified)
- [x] **Critical**: Update `StreamService` or test setup to handle authentication. (Verified - Test now logs in)
- [x] **Enhancement**: Use the real Dashboard page. (Verified)

### Security Review

- **Auth Verification**: The test now explicitly validates the login flow and accesses protected resources (`/dashboard/tenants/...`) with a valid session. This is a significant improvement over the previous bypass attempt.

### Performance Considerations

- **Latency Assertion**: The 500ms assertion remains a strict target. While correct for the requirement, it remains a potential source of flakiness in slower CI environments.

### Files Modified During Review

None.

### Gate Status
