## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Running E2E Tests

This project includes Playwright E2E tests to validate the end-to-end flow from metric ingestion to chart visualization.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure the application is running via Docker Compose
2. Database migrations have been run
3. E2E test data has been seeded

### Running Tests in Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Seed the E2E test data
docker exec -it observability-app php artisan db:seed --class=E2ETestDataSeeder

# 2. Run the E2E tests
docker exec -it observability-app npm run test:e2e
```

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# 1. Seed the E2E test data
cd app
php artisan db:seed --class=E2ETestDataSeeder

# 2. Run the E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Optional: Run with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Optional: Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Test Structure

- **Test Location**: `app/tests/e2e/smoke-test.spec.ts`
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Metric ingestion to chart display (< 500ms)
  - Multiple metrics in sequence
  - SSE connection stability

### Configuration

- **Playwright Config**: `app/playwright.config.ts`
- **Base URL**: `http://nginx` (for containerized tests)
- **Test Data**: Created by `E2ETestDataSeeder`
  - Tenant ID: `tenant-demo`
  - Test Token: `test-token-12345678901234567890123456789012`
  - Test User: `test@example.com` / `password`

### Authentication Flow

The E2E tests now use the real authentication flow:
1. Login to the application with test credentials
2. Navigate to the tenant dashboard
3. Test the full Ingest → SSE → Chart flow

This ensures the tests validate the actual user experience and properly test the authenticated SSE connection.
